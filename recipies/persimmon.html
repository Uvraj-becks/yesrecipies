    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Persimmon bread is the perfect easy recipe to make with a surplus of persimmon pulp.
    Using extra ripe hachiya persimmons, the sweet flesh is easy to scoop away from the persimmon skin with a spoon.
    For 1 cup of persimmon pulp, you'll need 2 to 3 hachiya persimmons, depending on their size.
    You can also use smaller fuyu persimmons, which typically take longer to fully ripen than hachiya.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
